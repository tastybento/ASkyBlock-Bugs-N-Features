## Bug reports
Create an issue to submit a bug report. Before you do, check the other issues - maybe it was already submitted.
If it's not a [Duplicate], we'll investigate the bug you reported. You **should** give us as much information as possible in order to make us able to replicate it. We might need you to tell us more about the bug you encountered, so please regularly check if there is a tag [Waiting for response] on your issue.

Keep in mind we **do not support old ASkyBlock version**, and we will close your issue if we don't receive answers for more than a week.

Here is a list of what you must include in your bug report :
* Server & ASkyBlock version
* If this is an error in the console, include the error log
* What does the bug consist of?
* How did this happen?

Here is a list of questions you should answer to be sure you don't forget anything :
* Are you using a Proxy? (BungeeCord, ...) ; or are you running on offline mode?
* Does it often happen?
* Did you update/install a plugin?
* What plugins are you using on your server?
* Have you got screenshots or videos of the bug? (if yes : don't forget to add them to the issue).
